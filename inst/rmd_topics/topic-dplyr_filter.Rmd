## Description

The [`filter()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/filter.html) function is part of the [`{dplyr}`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) package, which is part of the [`{tidyverse}`](https://www.tidyverse.org/).

It is used to **subset rows** from tibbles (data frames). Rows are kept if the given logical statement (code that gives `TRUE` or `FALSE`) is `TRUE`. Use this function if you only want to keep certain rows, aka certain observations."


<!-- Add the following if the topic is a function that does NOT come with base R, and uncomment/fill in the subsequent multiline HTML comment: -->
To use this function, you need to either first load the `{dplyr}` library, or always use the function with `dplyr::filter()` notation.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Load the library
library(dplyr)
# Or, load the full tidyverse:
library(tidyverse)

# Or, use :: notation
dplyr::filter()
```



## Conceptual usage 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
tibble %>% 
  filter(logical statement)

tibble %>% 
  filter(logical statement,
         another logical statement,
         and more logical statements that you want to all be TRUE)

```

## Examples


```{r}
# Subset penguins to keep only rows (observations) that are 'Gentoo' species (rows where it is TRUE that species == 'Gentoo')" 
penguins %>% 
  filter(species == "Gentoo")
```

<br>  <!-- Do not delete the <br>, and make sure to keep the previous and following lines blank. -->


```{r}
# Subset penguins to keep only rows with bill lengths greater than 45
penguins %>%
  filter(bill_length_mm > 45)
```

<br> 


```{r}
# Subset penguins to keep only rows where the species is 'Gentoo' and the island is 'Biscoe'
penguins %>%
  filter(species == "Gentoo", island == "Biscoe")
```

<br> 

```{r}
# Subset penguins to keep only rows where the species is _either_ 'Gentoo' or 'Adelie'
# In other words, it should be TRUE that the species is %in% the array c("Gentoo", "Adelie"). 
# Remember: We do _not_ use `==` when asking if a value is in an array.
penguins %>%
  filter(species %in% c("Gentoo", "Adelie"))
```
