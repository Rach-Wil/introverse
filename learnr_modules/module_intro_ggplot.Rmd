## Background: The `ggplot2` package

This lab focuses on making figures using the `ggplot2` package, which is one of several [`tidyverse`](https://tidyverse.tidyverse.org/) packages. To obtain `ggplot2`, you will need to first _install_ the library, and then _load_ the library for use in your current R session. **The library has already been installed for you**, but IF you were to install it, here's what you would do!

The command to install packages is `install.packages()` - you must provide package names _in quotes!_ to this function:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("ggplot2")
```
You may see red text going down the console - don't worry! These are just messages indicating the stage of installation; they are not errors. **You only need to run package installation ONCE within a given RStudio Cloud space (or, once on your computer)**. Once it has been installed, you can use the package by loading it when needed.


Once this package installation completes, you can load packages for use with the `library()` function (quotes or no quotes, doesn't matter here):
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
# or, library("ggplot2), or library('ggplot2')
```

**AGAIN, THIS HAS BEEN DONE FOR YOU IN THESE INTERACTIVE EXERCISES! YOU DON'T NEED TO RUN THIS CODE!!**


## Background: The data

All exercises here will use a pre-loaded dataset called `sparrows`. This dataset was collected in 1898 by Hermon Bumpus, an American biologist working at Brown University (fun fact: Dr. Spielman's *alma mater*!). Immediately following a bad winter storm, he collected 136 English house sparrows (some alive, some dead), *Passer domesticus*, and brought them indoors. Of these birds, 64 had died during the storm, but 72 recovered and survived. Bumpus measured the birds' physical traits (in mm or g) and recorded them for future generations of data science students.

**Before you begin the exercises, examine the dataset here!!**

```{r examine-sparrows, exercise=TRUE}
sparrows
```


## Set 1: Scatterplots 

Scatterplots show the **relationship** between two variables, and they use the `geom_point()` geometry as shown in this example where sparrow Weight is plotted *across* sparrow Wingspread (y goes across x!).

```{r scatter_demo, exercise = TRUE}
ggplot(sparrows) + # Use the sparrows dataset
  aes(x = Wingspread, y = Weight) +  # Specify columns Wingspread and Weight to go on x and y axis. 
  geom_point() # Use points
```


1. Make a scatterplot of wingspread across femur length.

> Hint: You may want to use the function `head()` or `names()` (try it out!!) to remind yourself what the relevant column names from the `sparrows` dataset are!!

```{r scatter_1, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r scatter_1-solution}
ggplot(sparrows) + 
  aes(x = Wingspread, y = Femur_Length) +  
  geom_point() 
```

2. Again make a scatterplot of wingspread across femur length, but make all points the color red.

> Hint: This is simply coloring points, not mapping color to a variable. Just add the color argument to `geom_point()`.

```{r scatter_2, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r scatter_2-solution}
ggplot(sparrows) + 
  aes(x = Wingspread, y = Femur_Length) +  
  geom_point(color = "red") 
```

3. Again make a scatterplot of wingspread across femur length, but this time color all points _based on survival status_. 

> Hint: This IS mapping a variable to a color, so you need to place your color argument inside aes(). 


```{r scatter_3, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r scatter_3-solution}
ggplot(sparrows) + 
  aes(x = Wingspread, y = Femur_Length, color=Survival) +  
  geom_point() 
```

4. Again make a scatterplot of wingspread across femur length, but this time color all points based on _weight_. Unlike survival, weight is a *numeric continuous* variable so you'll get a gradient of colors rather than a color for each survival category.
```{r scatter_4, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r scatter_4-solution}
ggplot(sparrows) + 
  aes(x = Wingspread, y = Femur_Length, color=Weight) +  
  geom_point() 
```


5. Again make a scatterplot of wingspread across femur length, with points colored based on _weight_. But this time, let's add some more professional labels to the plot using the `labs()` function, which you can see in action [here](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/labs.html). The code below changes the X-axis label as shown - run and understand the code, and then add in the following y-axis label and title:

+ Y axis: "Femur Length (mm)"
+ Title: "Scatterplot of sparrow wingspread and femur length"
+ For some extra bells and whistles, try adding a caption or subtitle!!
```{r scatter_5, exercise = TRUE}
ggplot(sparrows) + 
  aes(x = Wingspread, y = Femur_Length, color=Weight) +  
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Wingspread (mm)")
```

```{r scatter_5-solution}
ggplot(sparrows) + 
  aes(x = Wingspread, y = Femur_Length, color=Weight) +  
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Wingspread (mm)",
       y = "Femur Length (mm)",
       title = "Scatterplot of sparrow wingspread and femur length")
```

6. The code below makes a scatterplot of wingspread across femur length with points colored by _Age_. You'll notice in the legend that "Young" comes before "Adult" - this is because R interprets the order alphabetically by default! To change the order, we need to change the **levels** of the factor variable `Age`. Follow the comments and the code below to change the order of `Age` and remake the plot.

```{r scatter_6, exercise = TRUE}
ggplot(sparrows) + 
  aes(x = Wingspread, y = Femur_Length, color=Age) +  
  geom_point()

# See the default order of a factor with the levels() function
levels(sparrows$Age)

# RE-DEFINE the order like this. Run this code to see:
# This *permanently* changes the Age column in sparrows, unless you change it again later
sparrows$Age <- as.factor(sparrows$Age, levels=c("Young", "Adult"))
levels(sparrows$Age)

# Now you can re-make the plot using the re-defined sparrows data frame
# Literally re-run the plotting code at the top of this exercise chunk
```
7. The code below makes a scatterplot of wingspread across femur length with points colored by _Sex_. Using the same approach as in the previous question, make "Male" come BEFORE "Female" in the plot.

```{r scatter_7, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r scatter_7-solution}
# See the default order of a factor with the levels() function
# Always always look at the data before changing ANY definitions!!!
levels(sparrows$Sex)

# RE-DEFINE the order like this. Run this code to see:
# This *permanently* changes the Age column in sparrows, unless you change it again later
sparrows$Sex <- as.factor(sparrows$Age, levels=c("Female", "Male"))

# Confirm that the re-level worked:
levels(sparrows$Sex)

# And plot:
ggplot(sparrows) + 
  aes(x = Wingspread, y = Femur_Length, color=Sex) +  
  geom_point()
```

8. Finally, let's play with point size and shape. [This website](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sthda.com%2Fenglish%2Fwiki%2Fr-plot-pch-symbols-the-different-point-shapes-available-in-r&psig=AOvVaw0OJUM40mKjvj8_grWKRxXT&ust=1600267681741000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CAIQjRxqFwoTCODXw-ez6-sCFQAAAAAdAAAAABAD) shows all the different shapes in R you can use - we specify them with numbers. (Note: this website shows some example plotting using a non-`ggplot2` approach. Ignore that. We only care about the point symbols!) The plot below contains larger points at size 2, and points shaped like triangles. As always, first run and understand the template code. Then, modify the code to make the points size 3 and with a new point style of your choosing!!

> Hint: We are literally providing a single size and shape, NOT mapping size and shape to the data! Therefore, they are regular arguments to `geom_point()`, NOT to `aes()`.

```{r scatter_8, exercise = TRUE}
ggplot(sparrows) + 
  aes(x = Wingspread, y = Femur_Length) +  
  geom_point(size = 2, shape = 17)
```

```{r scatter_8-solution}
ggplot(sparrows) + 
  aes(x = Wingspread, y = Femur_Length) +  
  geom_point(size = 3, shape = 18)
```

9. Shapes 21-25 are actually a little different from other shapes - they can be colored *and filled*. Here, color means *outline* and fill means *fill*. Re-make the scatterplot but specify shape = 21, and specify a color and fill of your choosing to `geom_point()` to see this in action.

> Hint: Don't forget the magical PDF of all the [R colors](https://github.com/sjspielman/datascience_for_biologists/raw/master/spring2020/rmd_lessons/static/Rcolor.pdf) ! Have some fun :)

```{r scatter_9, exercise = TRUE}

```


```{r scatter_9-solution}
ggplot(sparrows) + 
  aes(x = Wingspread, y = Femur_Length) +  
  geom_point(shape = 21, color = "navy", fill ="cadetblue")
```


10. Make on more version of this figure that contains the following features:

+ Clean and professional labels using `labs()`
+ *Color* all points based on `Survival` 
+ *SIZE* all points based on `Weight` (Hint: use `size` as an aesthetic to map the given variable)
+ Make all the points into shape 15

Once the plot is made, think about these design choices. Just because one *can* add these visual features, does it mean one *should* add these visual features? (Answer: No.)
```{r scatter_10, exercise = TRUE}

```


```{r scatter_10-solution}
ggplot(sparrows) + 
  aes(x = Wingspread, y = Femur_Length, color = Survival, size = Weight) +  
  geom_point(shape = 15) + 
    labs(x = "Wingspread (mm)",
       y = "Femur Length (mm)",
       title = "Scatterplot of sparrow wingspread and femur length",
       caption = "Oh wow is this an ugly plot!")
```
